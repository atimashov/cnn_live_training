## Live CNN Training Dashboard
![alt text](https://github.com/atimashov/cnn_live_training/blob/main/dash.png?raw=true)
This repository represents dashboard for live training CNN model. The idea is to be able to train CNN model, change parameters "on the way" and see immediate result. It might be helpfult to nurture "feeling" of training neural network.

### Available features (real-time)
* Loss function;
* Accuracy;
* Activation maps distributions;

### Available tuning features
* change optimizer (Adam & SGD + Nesterov);
* change learning rate (step is 0.00005);
* change weight decay;
* change dropout (20% - 80%, step is 1%)
